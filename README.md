# Passifier

Generate Apple Passbook passes in Ruby

Passifier does most of the hard work and will easier allow you to automate generating pkpass files. You simply supply
  
* A Hash of metadata and layout (basically pass.json for those experienced)
* Image urls and paths
* The location of your key/certificate files
* Output path for the generated .pkpass file
  
## Installation

  gem install passifier
